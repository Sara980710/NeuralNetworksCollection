# YOLOv5

* CSP backbone
* PA-NET neck
* mosaic data augmentation
* auto learning bounding box anchors

Quotes from [blog post](https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov5-is-here/) by Joseph Nelson and Jacob Solawetz:
“Running a Tesla P100, we saw inference times up to 0.007 seconds per image, meaning 140 frames per second (FPS)! By contrast, YOLO v4 achieved 50 FPS after having been converted to the same Ultralytics PyTorch library.”

“YOLO v5 is small. Specifically, a weights file for YOLO v5 is 27 megabytes. Our weights file for YOLO v4 (with Darknet architecture) is 244 megabytes. YOLO v5 is nearly 90 percent smaller than YOLO v4.”
